# ms404_reverse_pot_adapter
 a simple pcb to alow mounting modern potentiometers in the doepfer ms404


1. dissasemble the ms404 and desolder the old potentiometers, the pot values are written on the PCB Except for the filter resonance potentiometer(that's the only antilog pot). check and reflow/bridge any bad connections on the ms404 PCB , the ms404 suffers a lot from bad solder joints, because the original panel mount pots  cause the PCB to flex a lot.

2. add bridge wires in the places where the pot chassis was acting as a jumper for GND.

3. solder some long square pin headers in the PCB, 

4. fit the potentiometers to the front panel. the feet should be pointing up.

5. partially reassemble the ms404, everything except for the top panel,this will insure proper alignment of the pots.

6. add the adapter PCBs and solder them in , make sure you leave a gap at the fron between the adapter PCBs and the front panel.
